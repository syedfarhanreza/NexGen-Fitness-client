                <p>
                  NeXGen Fitness began its journey in 2008 when founders Sarah
                  Williams and Michael Thompson set out to create superior
                  fitness products from their garage in Austin, Texas. Their
                  first innovation, an ergonomic and long-lasting resistance
                  band, quickly became a staple in the local fitness community,
                  marking the start of NeXGen Fitness's evolution.
